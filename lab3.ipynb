    "Your task this week will be broken down into two parts. In part 1 you will create a function to check whether a sensor measurement is above or below a particular threshold value. In part 2 you will write functions that will be designed to simulate tests of your sensor system to check whether your thresholding function works correctly. By completing both parts of this assignment, you will get a taste of the design process used by engineers who develop software for interface with physical systems and sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1 - Hysteresis Threshold\n",
    "For this assignment, we will imagine that we are building a system to monitor the temperature inside a furnace used in chemical industrial processes like cement production. While your colleagues design the electronics and mechanical components for the sensor and heater circuits, you have been asked to write the software that will read measurements from the temperature sensor and determine when to turn the heater on or off. Your team wishes to use the following simple piecewise function to describe the state of the heater as a function of the temperature, $T$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "state(T) =\n",
    "\\begin{cases} \n",
    "on & \\text{if } T < T_{desired} \\\\\n",
    "off & \\text{if } T \\geq T_{desired}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "that is, when the current temperature $T$ is less than the desired temperate, $T_{desired}$, the heater should be on, otherwise the heater should be off. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task for this part of the lab will be to write a function, `heat_control_hysteresis_thresh`, that determines whether the heater should be on or off based on the current temperature measurement from the sensor. Before you start, however, your colleagues inform you that the sensor readings are \"noisy\" (see figure 1) and using the simple piecewise threshold function above will result in the heater excessively switching between on and off states.\n",

    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $T$ is the current temperature reading from the sensor, $T_{desired}$ is the desired temperate, $current\\_state$ is the current state of the heater (on or off), $next\\_state$ is the next state of the heater (on or off), and $\\alpha$ is a constant. Now our function has thresholds at $T_{desired} \\pm \\alpha$. If $|T-T_{desired}| \\leq \\alpha$, then the heater should remain in the same state (e.g., if the heater is on, it should remain on). Figure 2 shows the behaviour of the heater using this control scheme. \n",

    "#### Testing your function\n",
    "To test your function, you may find if helpful to use an online graphing tool like [desmos](https://desmos.com) to create plots of the sensor simulation function with different values of $C_{0-4}$. Alternatively, you can use the function `plot_timeseries_and_threshold` provided below to plot and visualize the sensor readings and the hysteresis threshold. **This function uses libraries and concepts that are beyond the scope of APS106; you are not responsible for understanding how it works**. It is only provided to help you test you function.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `plot_timeseries_and_threshold` function or using Descmos, you can then count the number of crossings your function should detect. Remember to think about edge cases as you design your tests! If you're not sure how to design tests for this function, ask your TA for some tips :). Hint: start with simple functions and set most of the coefficients equal to zero."
