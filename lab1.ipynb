    "## Part 1 - Cartesian to polar coordinate conversion\n",
    "For many problems in engineering and sciences, analysis can be simplified by converting between different coordinate systems. A common transformation is to convert 2-dimensional cartesian coordinates (x and y components) to polar coordinates (magnitude and phase angle). Fig 1 below illustrates how a vector can be defined using either coordinate system. Examples of situations where such transformations are commonly used include analysis of AC circuits, mechatronic control systems, ionic flow in fluids, and quantum mechanics.\n",

    "Once you have written your function, you need to verify that it works correctly. Testing code involves generating sets of test inputs (called *test cases*), running the code with those inputs, and then verifying the outputs match the expected value. This week, we will walk you through some strategies for testing your functions. As we progress further into the semester and your programs become more complex, we will provide less explicit testing instructions and you will be responsible for testing your code. Developing good testing habits now will make you a better programmer and more efficient later in the course and in your career!\n",

You start shopping around and find a bike that has a great price. But after some research, you find that the company making the bike only tests their bike designs indoors on flat surfaces. So you have no idea how the bike will perform on a mountain trail! Would you trust and buy this bike? Best case the bike works fine but you might be nervous using it; worst case the bike falls apart, potentially injuring you or, at least, making you sad. You would be better off buying a bike that has been tested and evaluated for the conditions it is designed for.\n",

So practice and develop good habits around testing now and you will reap the rewards later on.\n",

Even though we changed the input and got a different result, all we're testing is whether our function implemented the equation correctly. We have not tested the other components of our function. Let's look at another example to understand what we mean. This time, let's increase the time parameter significantly to `260.8`."
